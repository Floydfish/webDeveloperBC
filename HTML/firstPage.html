        She looks like one. Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! 
        Well, I got better. You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and 
        boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, 
        so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English 
        K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!
    </p>
    <p>
        What a strange person. She looks like one. Well, what do you want? Why 
        do you think that she is a witch? <strong> Listen.</strong> <em> Strange
        women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system 
        of government.</em> Supreme executive power derives from a mandate 
        from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
    </p>
    <h2>Burn her!</h2>
    <p>
        The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! We found them. I dunno. 
        Must be a king. Well, how'd you become king, then?
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>I have to push the pram a lot.</li>
        <li>
            Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter 
            who lives beyond these woods.
        </li>
        <li>You don't vote for kings.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>
        I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food 
        trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a 
        hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am 
        forced to taunt you a second time!
    </h3>
    <p>
        I am your king. And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Ah, now we 
        see the violence inherent in the system! I'm not a witch. No, no, no! 
        Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Why?</li>
        <li>Look, my liege!</li>
        <li>I am your king.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Shut up! The nose? You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil 
        your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called 
        Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!
    </p>
    <p>
        Bloody Peasant! How do you know she is a witch? The swallow may fly 
        south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer 
        climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. Burn her!
    </p>
    <p>
        Shut up! No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Oh! Come and
        see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being 
        repressed! Bloody Peasant! On second thoughts, let's not go there. 
        It is a silly place.
    </p>
    <p>
        We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. We found them.
        No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Well, Mercia's a 
        temperate zone! Why? No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart.
    </p>
    <p>
        And the hat. She's a witch! Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers 
        who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. I'm not a witch. 
        I'm not a witch. We found them. But you are dressed as oneâ€¦
    </p>
    <p>
        You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart 
        threw a sword at you! Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! Well, I got 
        better. Look, my liege! I have to push the pram a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
        And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Camelot! Did you dress 
        her up like this? No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. 
        Well, what do you want?
    </p>
    <p>
        You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart 
        threw a sword at you! Camelot! The swallow may fly south with the sun, 
        and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, 
        yet these are not strangers to our land.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where'd you get the coconuts? Shut up! Why do you think that she is a 
        witch? Why?
    </p>
    <p>
        Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! You don't frighten us, English 
        pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my 
        nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English 
        K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, look here, my good man. Camelot! Camelot! I'm not a witch. Burn 
        her anyway!
